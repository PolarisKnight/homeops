# ArgoCD in a Rancher RKE2 Cluster

Welcome to the repository for managing my homelab Kubernetes cluster using Rancher + ArgoCD! This project is part of my journey to learn and experiment with GitOps principles, Kubernetes, and modern infrastructure management practices. As someone who has a background in IT operations utilizing VMs and Docker containers, this is a logical next step for my learning.

## About This Project

This repository is a key component of my homelab setup, where I use Rancher + ArgoCD to:

- Automate deployments and configurations for my RKE2 cluster.
- Explore GitOps workflows and best practices.
- Experiment with Kubernetes-based application management.

The homelab serves as a sandbox environment for testing tools, learning new concepts, and improving my skills in Kubernetes and related technologies.

## Why ArgoCD?

ArgoCD is a powerful, mature and popular GitOps tool that simplifies cluster management by:

- **Declarative Configurations**: All cluster state is stored in Git, making changes auditable and reversible.
- **Continuous Reconciliation**: Fleet continuously ensures the cluster matches the desired state.
- **Scalability**: Ideal for small setups like this homelab or large-scale production environments.

## Project Goals

1. **Learn GitOps**: Understand and implement GitOps principles in a real-world scenario.
2. **Enhance Kubernetes Knowledge**: Gain hands-on experience with Kubernetes tooling and workflows.
3. **Streamline Homelab Management**: Use automation to simplify infrastructure management.
