# README: Flux in K3s Cluster

Welcome to the repository for managing my homelab Kubernetes cluster using Flux! This project is part of my journey to learn and experiment with GitOps principles, Kubernetes, and modern infrastructure management practices.

---

## About This Project

This repository is a key component of my homelab setup, where I use Flux to:

- Automate deployments and configurations for my K3s cluster.
- Explore GitOps workflows and best practices.
- Experiment with Kubernetes-based application management.

The homelab serves as a sandbox environment for testing tools, learning new concepts, and improving my skills in Kubernetes and related technologies.

## Why Flux?

Flux is a powerful GitOps tool that simplifies cluster management by:

- **Declarative Configurations**: All cluster state is stored in Git, making changes auditable and reversible.
- **Continuous Reconciliation**: Flux continuously ensures the cluster matches the desired state.
- **Scalability**: Ideal for small setups like this homelab or large-scale production environments.

## Project Goals

1. **Learn GitOps**: Understand and implement GitOps principles in a real-world scenario.
2. **Enhance Kubernetes Knowledge**: Gain hands-on experience with Kubernetes tooling and workflows.
3. **Streamline Homelab Management**: Use automation to simplify infrastructure management.

## Repository Structure

- **clusters/my-cluster**: Contains Kubernetes manifests for the cluster.
- **flux-system**: Configuration for Flux components.
- **applications/**: Manifests for apps deployed in the cluster.
